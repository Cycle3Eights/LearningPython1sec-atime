## Variables!!! :DDDDDDDDDD, I used probably like one variable in section 3
# some variables include, variables are also kinda like storing it in a box, which then you would use later
# you'd pull it out using a print command

gotcha = 2 + 2
print(gotcha)

roundednumber5 = 500 / 25 # This stores value into rounded number 5, that value is the result of 500/25
print(roundednumber5)

print(roundednumber5 + gotcha) # should print 24. if it doesn't then uhhh something wrong.
