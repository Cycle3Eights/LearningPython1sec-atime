## Variables!!! :DDDDDDDDDD, I used probably like one variable in section 3
# some variables include, variables are also kinda like storing it in a box, which then you would use later
# you'd pull it out using a print command

gotcha = 2 + 2
print(gotcha)

roundednumber5 = 500 / 25 # This stores value into rounded number 5, that value is the result of 500/25
print(roundednumber5)

print(roundednumber5 + gotcha) # should print 24. if it doesn't then uhhh something wrong.

# Variables consist of two parts -> value & name
# roundednumber5 is one variable, other such variables in other languages work as well,
# no spaces allowed, and must begin with a letter, symbols, numbers will not work.

inches3rd = 2+3
# 3inches = 2+3 ## THIS will show up as invalid.

print(inches3rd)

## There's keywords such as False, True, elif, def, etc. Try not to use them for names/variables.
# it probably would show up as invalid. OR cannot be assigned.

# False = 2 + 2 -> INVALID
myFalse = 300/60
print(myFalse)

## Some variable declarations below. BTW, MAKE sure to always be accurate w/ variable names, or error/invalid will appear.
# ex -> if instanceguh was printed w/ capital I, console will print a nameError and redirect to a similar name.
instanceguh = 250.0
instanceguh = instanceguh / 50
accbal = 78
accname = "DashedTony"
print(instanceguh, accbal, accname)
print("The current balance of", accname, "is:", instanceguh-accbal,)
